# Story 3.1: Admin Dashboard Layout

**Epic**: Data Analytics Dashboard  
**Assigned Agent**: ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Developer  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: 3

## User Story
**As a** campaign manager  
**I want** a comprehensive analytics dashboard with real-time metrics  
**So that** I can monitor campaign progress and make data-driven decisions  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard layout created using Untitled UI React components
- [ ] Real-time metrics displayed (total responses, completion rates, geographic coverage)
- [ ] Key performance indicators (KPIs) prominently featured
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Spanish language interface throughout
- [ ] Navigation to detailed analytics sections
- [ ] Auto-refresh capabilities for real-time data
- [ ] Loading states and error handling implemented

## Technical Requirements
### Dashboard Components Required
- Header with campaign context and user info
- KPI cards showing:
  - Total survey responses
  - Daily response count
  - Completion rate percentage
  - Active volunteer count
  - Geographic coverage percentage
- Quick stats widgets:
  - Top voter priorities chart
  - Party affiliation breakdown
  - Response trends over time
- Navigation sidebar for detailed analytics
- Mobile-responsive grid layout

### Untitled UI Components to Use
- `Card` for metric containers
- `Badge` for status indicators
- `Button` for navigation actions
- `Skeleton` for loading states
- `Alert` for error messages
- `Grid` system for responsive layout
- `Typography` for consistent text styling

### Real-time Data Integration
```typescript
// Supabase subscription for real-time updates
const { data, error } = supabase
  .from('survey_responses')
  .select('*')
  .on('INSERT', payload => {
    updateDashboardMetrics(payload.new)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

### Spanish Language Requirements
All text must be in Spanish:
- "Panel de AnÃ¡lisis" (Analytics Dashboard)
- "Respuestas Totales" (Total Responses)
- "Tasa de FinalizaciÃ³n" (Completion Rate)
- "Cobertura GeogrÃ¡fica" (Geographic Coverage)
- "Voluntarios Activos" (Active Volunteers)
- "Prioridades Principales" (Top Priorities)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dashboard page component created with TypeScript
- [ ] All KPI metrics display correctly
- [ ] Real-time data updates working via Supabase subscriptions
- [ ] Responsive layout tested on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Spanish language interface complete
- [ ] Loading states implemented for all data fetching
- [ ] Error handling for failed API calls
- [ ] Navigation to detailed analytics sections
- [ ] Unit tests written for dashboard components
- [ ] Component stories created in Storybook
- [ ] Performance optimized (< 3 second load time)
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1)

## Mobile-First Design Requirements
- Touch-friendly interface elements (44px minimum touch targets)
- Swipe gestures for navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sidebar for mobile screens
- Optimized chart sizes for small screens
- Readable typography at all screen sizes

## Performance Requirements
- Initial page load < 3 seconds
- Metric updates < 1 second after data change
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Efficient re-rendering with React optimization
- Lazy loading for non-critical components

## Dependencies
- Database architecture completed (Story 1.1)
- Survey data collection system working
- Authentication system implemented
- Sufficient sample data for realistic metrics

## Blockers/Risks
- Real-time subscriptions may impact performance
- Complex KPI calculations could slow dashboard load
- Mobile layout challenges with multiple metrics
- Spanish translation accuracy requirements

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Dashboard loads with sample data
- [ ] All KPIs display correct calculations
- [ ] Real-time updates trigger UI changes
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout works correctly
- [ ] Spanish text displays properly
- [ ] Loading states appear during data fetch
- [ ] Error states handle network failures
- [ ] Navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Accessibility features work with screen readers

## API Requirements
Dashboard needs these endpoints:
```typescript
// Get dashboard metrics
GET /api/analytics/dashboard-metrics
Response: {
  totalResponses: number,
  dailyCount: number,
  completionRate: number,
  activeVolunteers: number,
  geographicCoverage: number,
  topPriorities: Array<{priority: string, count: number}>,
  partyBreakdown: Array<{party: string, percentage: number}>
}

// Get response trends
GET /api/analytics/response-trends?period=7d
Response: Array<{date: string, count: number}>
```

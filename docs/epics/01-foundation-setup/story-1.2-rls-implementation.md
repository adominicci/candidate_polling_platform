# Story 1.2: Row Level Security Implementation

**Epic**: Foundation Setup  
**Assigned Agent**: üóÑÔ∏è Database Architect  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: 1

## User Story
**As a** security officer  
**I want** data access controlled at the database level  
**So that** users can only access data from their organization  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] RLS policies implemented for all tables
- [x] Tenant isolation enforced at database level
- [x] Role-based access controls (admin, analyst, volunteer, manager)
- [x] No cross-tenant data leakage possible
- [x] Automated tests for RLS policies
- [x] Policy documentation created

## Technical Requirements
### RLS Policies Required

#### Tenant Isolation Policies
```sql
-- Example policy structure
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation" ON table_name
FOR ALL USING (
  tenant_id = (
    SELECT tenant_id FROM users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

#### Role-Based Access Policies
- **Admin**: Full access to all data within tenant
- **Analyst**: Read-only access to aggregated data, no PII
- **Volunteer**: Can only create/read own survey submissions
- **Manager**: Read access to all data, limited write access

#### Specific Policies Needed
- `survey_responses` table: Volunteers can only insert their own data
- `answers` table: Tied to survey_response permissions
- `users` table: Users can read own profile, admins can manage all
- `precincts` table: Read access based on assignments
- `walklists` table: Volunteers can only see assigned lists

## Definition of Done
- [x] RLS enabled on all tables
- [x] Tenant isolation policies created and tested
- [x] Role-based policies implemented
- [x] Policy bypass prevention tested
- [x] Cross-tenant access blocked and verified
- [x] Performance impact assessed and optimized
- [x] Automated test suite for RLS policies
- [x] Security review passed
- [x] Documentation updated

## Security Test Cases
- [x] User from Tenant A cannot access Tenant B data
- [x] Volunteer cannot access other volunteer's data
- [x] Analyst cannot access raw PII data
- [x] Manager cannot modify system configuration
- [x] Unauthenticated access properly blocked
- [x] JWT manipulation attempts fail
- [x] SQL injection attempts fail against policies

## Dependencies
- Database schema must be complete (Story 1.1)
- User authentication system (Story 1.4)
- JWT token structure defined

## Blockers/Risks
- Complex policy interactions may cause performance issues
- Policy logic errors could create security vulnerabilities
- Testing all permission combinations is complex

## Performance Requirements
- Query performance degradation < 10% with RLS enabled
- Policy evaluation time < 50ms per query
- No impact on read-only analytics queries

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Each role tested against each table
- [x] Cross-tenant access attempts blocked
- [x] Policy performance benchmarked
- [x] Edge cases identified and tested
- [x] Automated test suite running
- [x] Manual penetration testing completed
- [x] Code review by DevOps & Security agent

## Resources
- Supabase RLS documentation
- PostgreSQL RLS best practices
- Security testing guidelines
- JWT token structure documentation

## Completion Status
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - QA VERIFIED  
**Completion Date**: January 9, 2025

# Story 1.1: Database Architecture Setup

**Epic**: Foundation Setup  
**Assigned Agent**: üóÑÔ∏è Database Architect  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: 1

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a secure, scalable database with proper tenant isolation  
**So that** multiple organizations can use the platform securely  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension enabled
- [x] All core tables created according to schema design
- [x] Proper relationships and constraints established
- [x] UUID primary keys for all tables
- [x] Audit fields (created_at, updated_at) on all tables
- [x] Multi-tenant architecture implemented
- [x] Database schema documented

## Technical Requirements
### Core Tables to Create
- `tenants` - Multi-organization support
- `users` - User management with roles  
- `precincts` - Geographic boundaries with PostGIS
- `walklists` - Assignment management for volunteers
- `questionnaires` - Survey templates with versioning
- `sections` - Questionnaire sections
- `questions` - Individual questions with various types
- `survey_responses` - Collected responses
- `answers` - Individual answers to questions

### Database Features Required
- UUID primary keys for all tables
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Check constraints for data integrity
- Indexes for performance optimization
- PostGIS extension for geographic data
- Audit triggers for updated_at fields

## Definition of Done
- [x] Database schema migration created and applied
- [x] All tables created with proper structure
- [x] Relationships and constraints tested
- [x] Sample data inserted for testing
- [x] Schema documentation updated
- [x] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [x] Code reviewed by API Backend Engineer
- [x] Integration tested with Supabase client

## Dependencies
- Supabase project already exists (completed)
- Survey questions structure from survey_questions.json

## Blockers/Risks
- PostGIS configuration complexity
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Multi-tenant data isolation requirements

## Testing Checklist
- [x] All tables can be created without errors
- [x] Foreign key relationships work correctly
- [x] UUID generation works for all primary keys
- [x] PostGIS functions work for geographic data
- [x] Audit triggers fire on updates
- [x] Sample data insertion succeeds
- [x] Query performance meets benchmarks

## Resources
- Supabase PostgreSQL documentation
- PostGIS documentation
- survey_questions.json structure
- Database schema design in project docs

## Completion Status
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Completion Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Completed By**: üóÑÔ∏è Database Architect  

### Validation Notes
- All 9 core tables successfully created with proper UUID primary keys
- PostGIS extension enabled and tested with geographic data functions
- Multi-tenant architecture implemented with tenant_id fields across all tables
- Audit triggers configured for automatic updated_at timestamp management
- Foreign key relationships established and verified through constraint testing
- Sample data inserted and validated for all table structures
- Performance benchmarks exceeded requirements (average query time < 50ms)
- Schema documentation completed and code review passed

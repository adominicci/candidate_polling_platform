# Story 1.4: Authentication System

**Epic**: Foundation Setup  
**Assigned Agent**: ⚡ API Backend Engineer  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: 1

## User Story
**As a** user  
**I want** to securely log into the platform  
**So that** I can access features appropriate to my role  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Supabase Auth integration complete
- [x] JWT token handling implemented
- [x] Role-based route protection
- [x] Login/logout flows working
- [x] Password reset functionality
- [x] Session management
- [x] Spanish language auth messages

## Technical Requirements
### Authentication Features
- Email/password authentication
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Session persistence
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure logout

### User Roles to Support
- **Admin**: Full platform access
- **Analyst**: Analytics and reporting access
- **Volunteer**: Survey form access only
- **Manager**: Read access to campaign data

### API Endpoints Required
```typescript
// Authentication endpoints
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout  
POST /api/auth/refresh
POST /api/auth/reset-password
GET /api/auth/user
PUT /api/auth/user/profile
```

### JWT Token Structure
```typescript
interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string;           // user id
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'analyst' | 'volunteer' | 'manager';
  tenant_id: string;
  iat: number;
  exp: number;
}
```

## Definition of Done
- [x] Supabase Auth configured and working
- [x] Login form accepts email/password
- [x] JWT tokens generated on successful login
- [x] Tokens include user role and tenant_id
- [x] Protected routes redirect to login if unauthenticated
- [x] Role-based access control working
- [x] Logout clears session and redirects
- [x] Password reset emails sent
- [x] Token refresh handles expiration
- [x] Spanish error/success messages
- [x] Security testing passed

## Frontend Integration Requirements
### Protected Route Component
```typescript
// Protected route wrapper
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="volunteer">
  <SurveyForm />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### Auth Context Provider
```typescript
// Auth context for user state
interface AuthContext {
  user: User | null;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  loading: boolean;
}
```

## Security Requirements
- Password minimum 12 characters
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- HTTPS only for auth endpoints
- Secure cookie settings
- CSRF protection
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

## Spanish Language Messages
- Login success: "Sesión iniciada exitosamente"
- Login error: "Credenciales inválidas"
- Logout success: "Sesión cerrada"
- Password reset: "Enlace enviado a su correo"
- Session expired: "Su sesión ha expirado"

## Dependencies
- Database schema with users table (Story 1.1)
- RLS policies for user data access (Story 1.2)
- Next.js application setup (Story 1.3)

## Blockers/Risks
- Supabase Auth configuration complexity
- JWT token security considerations
- Role-based access logic complexity

## Testing Checklist
### Authentication Flow Tests
- [x] Valid login succeeds
- [x] Invalid login fails with proper message
- [x] Logout clears session
- [x] Protected routes redirect properly
- [x] Token refresh works before expiration
- [x] Password reset email sent
- [x] Role-based access enforced

### Security Tests
- [x] SQL injection attempts blocked
- [x] XSS attempts blocked
- [x] Rate limiting prevents brute force
- [x] CSRF protection active
- [x] Session hijacking prevented
- [x] JWT tampering detected

## Integration Points
- Frontend authentication components
- Database user management
- RLS policy integration
- API endpoint protection

## Resources
- Supabase Auth documentation
- Next.js authentication patterns
- JWT best practices
- React Auth context patterns
- Security testing guidelines

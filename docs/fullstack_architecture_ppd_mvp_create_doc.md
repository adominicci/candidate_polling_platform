# Fullstack Architecture — PPD MVP

## Section 9 — Risks & Mitigations

### 9.1 Technical Risks
- **Form Version Conflicts:** Field volunteers may use outdated questionnaires.
  - *Mitigation:* Version checks on submission, auto-refresh form on version mismatch.
- **Slow Map Rendering:** High-precision precinct shapes can affect performance.
  - *Mitigation:* Use generalized geometries for zoom < 12, browser caching.
- **Materialized View Staleness:** High traffic may cause data lag.
  - *Mitigation:* Incremental refresh RPC triggered post-submission for affected tenant.
- **RLS Policy Leaks:** Incorrect SQL may expose cross-tenant data.
  - *Mitigation:* Automated RLS tests in CI; pen-tests before pilot.

### 9.2 Operational Risks
- **Low Volunteer Adoption:** If the web app is too complex, data collection suffers.
  - *Mitigation:* Simplify UI, run training sessions, provide quick reference cards.
- **Poor Connectivity:** Rural areas may have slow connections.
  - *Mitigation:* Lightweight forms, progress indicators, automatic retry on failure.
- **Data Privacy Concerns:** Candidates may mishandle voter data.
  - *Mitigation:* Consent logging, audit trails, clear data use policies.

### 9.3 Political Risks
- **Perception of Bias:** Tool may be viewed as partisan.
  - *Mitigation:* Transparent data governance, optional anonymized mode.
- **Misinterpretation of Analytics:** Candidates may act on statistically insignificant patterns.
  - *Mitigation:* Show confidence intervals and minimum sample thresholds.

**Note:** All UI elements referenced for field users will be in Spanish to match volunteer and voter context, while the underlying architecture, API, and documentation remain in English for development clarity.
